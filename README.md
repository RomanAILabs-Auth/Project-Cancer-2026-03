🔬 Executive Summary

Project-Cancer-2026-03-OPTIMA represents a breakthrough in medicinal chemistry designed specifically to overcome the Hypoxia Barrier in solid tumors. By utilizing a "Metabolic Trojan Horse" approach, Chronos-7 (Gen-2) targets malignant cells through a dual-action mechanism: Oxygen-Independent Nitrosative Stress and Iron-Dependent Ferroptosis.

⚡ Mechanism of Action (MOA)
1. The Hypoxic Bypass (Nitrosative Stress)

Traditional ROS-based therapies fail in the oxygen-starved (hypoxic) cores of solid tumors. Chronos-7 carries its own "fuel" via the Nitrooxy (−ONO2​) group. Upon entering the acidic tumor microenvironment, the molecule releases Nitric Oxide (NO), inducing lethal nitrosative stress regardless of local oxygen levels.
2. Ferroptosis Induction

The morpholine-pyrrolidine scaffold acts as a high-affinity cooperative ligand. It chelates intracellular Fe2+, creating a localized redox center that triggers lipid peroxidation, effectively dissolving the cancer cell’s protective membrane.
⚗️ Synthesis Protocol (Three-Pot Sequence)
Pot 1: Core Scaffold Formation

    Reaction: Hantzsch Thiazole Synthesis.

    Conditions: Absolute Isopropanol (Azeotropic Distillation to 0.005% H2​O); 82∘C for 14h.

    Catalyst: Pd(OAc)2​ (2 mol%) / Xantphos.

Pot 2: Nitrooxy Integration (The Warhead)

    Reaction: Low-temp esterification.

    Conditions: Fuming HNO3​ / Acetic Anhydride at −18∘C(±1∘C).

    Critical Note: Addition must be slow-drop (0.5 mL/min) over 6 hours to prevent phenyl ring nitration.

Pot 3: Final Assembly & Salt Formation

    Reaction: Carbamoylation & Mesylation.

    Base: Hunig’s Base (Diisopropylethylamine) to ensure a clean reaction profile.

    Finish: Direct crystallization with Methanesulfonic acid in chilled THF.

📦 Preparation, Storage, and Delivery
Storage Requirements

    [!IMPORTANT]
    Storage Temperature: −80∘C (Ultra-Low Temperature Freezer) is MANDATORY. The nitrooxy moiety is thermally labile.

IV Formulation

    Vehicle: 20% PEG-400/80% Normal Saline.

    Stabilizer: 0.1% w/v Ascorbic Acid (USP) must be added as a radical scavenger during reconstitution.

    Potency: Stable for 24 hours at room temperature (25∘C) post-reconstitution.

🧪 Analytical Verification (2026 Standards)
1. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)

    1H-NMR(CDCl3​): Look for the characteristic morpholine multiplet at 3.4–3.7 ppm and the gem-dimethyl singlet at 1.55 ppm.

    13C-NMR: The quaternary carbon attached to the nitrooxy group should shift to approximately 82.5 ppm.

2. Mass Spectrometry (MS)

    High-Res MS: Target [M+H]+ peak at m/z557.1091.

3. Chromatography

    HPLC: ≥98.5% purity at UV254nm.

    TLC: Rf​=0.42 (Ethyl Acetate/Hexane 1:1).
